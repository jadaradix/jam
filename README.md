## Prerequisites

### yarn

yarn is a superior package manager, working as a replacement for the npm CLI. I recommend you use yarn over npm although a regular `npm install` will work. Install yarn:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

Grunt is a JavaScript task runner. Install Grunt:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Install

```
yarn
```


## Build

```
grunt
```

You can watch for JavaScript and Sass changes and rebuild automatically with these grunt tasks:

 * `grunt watch:javascript`
 * `grunt watch:sass`
